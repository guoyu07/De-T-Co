# De-T-Co

A chrome extension to take those annoying t.co links that twitter uses and replace them with the expanded url. No more slow load times just because of Twitter's infrastructure issues and their "short" urls.

## Install

[Use the chrome web store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/de-tco/jmdlmkhbhmlgkpjelenjcpgcldhednif)

The old .crx is [still available here](https://github.com/johnpbloch/De-T-Co/raw/master/de-t-co.crx), but I won't be updating it. In chrome, go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions) and drag the .crx file onto the page.

[You will find more detailed instructions here](http://theappslab.com/2012/08/16/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually-the-new-way/).
